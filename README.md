# Scene

# Inspiration
We are interested in augmented reality and hope to use this technology help make people's life easier.

# What it does
The app recognizes pictures of art works, famous people, and regular items and displays information about them.

# How we built it
We used the Vuforia SDK to implement augmented reality related functionalities, and used Unity to build the 3D environment.

# Challenges we ran into
Sometimes it didn't recognize the image, and the position/interactive functionality used not to work.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
It's really cool.

# What we learned
We've got new knowledge on augmented reality development and learned how to use Unity and Vuforia.

# What's next for Scene
Hopefully it will have a more generalized image recognition and people will use it to display actual data about items detected.
